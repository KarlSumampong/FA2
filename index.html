trends.

        3. Alerts and Suggestions

    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>Many tools for farmers are either too complicated or designed for large 
industrial operations. Spreadsheet tracking is manual and time-consuming. 
Traditional farm management software is expensive and often too complex for 
small-scale growers..<br>
GreenSense is different because it is:<br>
• Designed for small farms - Easy to use and affordable.<br>
• Actionable - Focuses on insights farmers can actually use, not just raw 
data.<br>
• Smart but simple - Uses AI to analyze trends without requiring farmers 
to understand complex math or technology.<br>Contact</p>
